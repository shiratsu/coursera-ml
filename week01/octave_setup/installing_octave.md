% brew install octave

(snip...)

The graphical user interface is now used when running Octave interactively.
The start-up option --no-gui will run the familiar command line interface.
The option --no-gui-libs runs a minimalist command line interface that does not
link with the Qt libraries and uses the fltk toolkit for plotting if available.


Gnuplot is configured as default graphics toolkit, this can be changed within
Octave using 'graphics_toolkit'. Other Gnuplot terminals can be used by setting
the environment variable GNUTERM and building gnuplot with the following options.

  setenv('GNUTERM','qt')    # Requires QT; install gnuplot --with-qt
  setenv('GNUTERM','x11')   # Requires XQuartz; install gnuplot --with-x11
  setenv('GNUTERM','wxt')   # Requires wxmac; install gnuplot --with-wxmac
  setenv('GNUTERM','aqua')  # Requires AquaTerm; install gnuplot --with-aquaterm
		
You may also set this variable from within Octave. For printing the cairo backend
is recommended, i.e., install gnuplot with --with-cairo, and use
		
  print -dpdfcairo figure.pdf
		  
		  
When using the native qt or fltk toolkits then invisible figures do not work because
osmesa does currently not work with the Mac's OpenGL implementation. The usage of
gnuplot is recommended.
		  
		  
Octave has been compiled with Apple's BLAS routines, this leads to segfaults in some
tests. The option "--with-openblas" is a more conservative choice.
